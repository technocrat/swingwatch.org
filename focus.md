## Without Pennsylvania and North Carolina combined

In 2020, Biden won Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes by 80,555 and Trump won North Carolina's 15 electoral votes by 74,483. These were the too largest margins in 2020 in count. As between the two candidates[^1], disregarding third party candidates, the margin in Pennsylvania was 1.18% in favor of Biden and the margin in North Carolina was 1.37% in favor of Trump.

In 2024, due to the use of the 2020 Census for apportionment, Pennsylvania will have 19 electoral votes and North Carolina will have 16.

Without Biden wins in both states, the winning scenarios for Biden narrow from  70 to just **five** combinations of the remaining swing states.

All Biden victory scenarios without both Pennsylvania and North Carolina require **winning both Georgia (16 votes) and Michigan (15 votes) plus Nevada (6 votes) and one of Arizona (11 votes) and Wisconsin (10 votes) *or,*  without Nevada *both* Arizona and Wisconsin."**

[^1]: Margins of victory are calculated as a candidate's popular vote divided by the combined popular vote for each candidate, neglecting third-party candidates.
[^2]: Swing Watch makes the assumption, unless otherwise stated, that each candidate will win the 49 states and electoral districts, other than the seven swing states, as they did in 2020, with the Electoral College outcome adjusted to the 2020 Census allocation of electoral votes.
