## Tie scenario

If **President Biden wins only Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin** the outcome will be a 269-269 tie in the Electoral College. This assumes that Biden does not win Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona or Nevada, each of which Trump wins. Otherwise, every remaining state is won by the candidate who won it in 2020. 

## Constitutional framework for a tied vote

> The person having the greatest number of votes for President, shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. But in choosing the President, the **votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote**; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and **a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice**.

U.S. Constitution, Twelfth Amendment [emphasis added]

## Current situation

A majority of 50 state delegations is 26, which is currently what the Republican Party controls. In addition, Maine, Minnesota and North Carolina have equally divided delegations. The remaining 20 delegations are controlled by the Democratic party.

## Following the presidential and congressional elections

If the Republican Party retains control of 26 states, it is in a position to choose the President.

If the Republican Party loses control of one state, no party has sole power to choose the President.

In that case, the provisions of the [Presidential Succession Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/19) come into operation.

Should a majority of states fail to agree on the selection of the President and also fail to agree on the selection of a Vice President, the Speaker of the House will become President on Inauguration Day or, if there is no Speaker, the President Pro Tem of the Senate. If there should be no President Pro Tem of the Senate, the Secretary of State would become President.
