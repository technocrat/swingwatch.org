In an election that may be decided by a few electoral votes, for Harris to win it is not sufficient that he win the popular votes in the decisive swing states. He must also retain the vote of the *electors* in all states in which he wins. In states that lack enforceable safeguards, an elector motivated to make a political demonstration about, the war in Gaza, for example, could cast what he or she considers a protest vote, depriving Harris of a vote needed to reach 270 and an Electoral College victory. Even if it were thought that such a protest vote would not be decisive more than a single elector might be relying on the same notion. Being an elector is usually considered an honorary, ministerial role, but the scope of decision making autonomy of electors depends on state law.
