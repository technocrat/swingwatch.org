Apart from voter concerns regarding irregular border crossings for purposes of making asylum claims, non-citizens might also be concerned by Trump's statements regarding mass deportation. Not all non-citizens are in undocumented status; however in three states, non-citizens constitute approximately 10% of the total adult population. While they are not themselves voters, some are in family relationship with those who are or have otherwise may influence voters. A Pew estimate reported by [NBC](https://apple.news/A5Uc7V1GrTGiGQ6ybsMayig) estimates that one in 25 US households include an undocumented member. Also, [Pew reports](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/02/14/around-four-in-ten-latinos-in-u-s-worry-that-they-or-someone-close-to-them-could-be-deported/) that in 2021 about 25% of U.S. born Latinos are concerned about how potential deportations under a second Trump administration would affect someone they know.
