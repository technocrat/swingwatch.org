The number of "likely voter" polls increased substantially in the second half of September. As a result, the model has beens revised to excluded "registered voter" surveys and to include all likely voter polls from August to late September. As before, the beginning assumptions include a close contest in the range of Harris taking between 48% and 52% of vote in each swing state. This is a "strong" prior and pronounced polling results will be required to move the credible interval outside that range. The model is based on the *Bayesian analysis*  described in [Methodology](/method]).

## Overall assessment for polling through September 30, 2024

Harris is likely to win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin and perhaps Nevada. his would result in a 270-239 win, assuming no changes from the 2020 election in other states and electoral districts.
