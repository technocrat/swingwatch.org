Following President Biden's withdrawal in favor of Vice President Harris in July, the previous model's beginning assumptions fell into question. Specifically, the 2020 and 2024 elections no longer have identical opposing candidates. The previous model therefore began with the 2020 results and updated with the polling results. Updating the model with the  some random variation to account for the change. However, the polling results during July did not reflect any change from the previous month when Biden was still the candidate.

As a result, the beginning assumptions were revised to reflect a close contest in the range of Harris taking between 48% and 52% of vote in each swing state. This is a "strong" prior and pronounced polling results will be required to move the credible interval outside that range. The model is based on the *Bayesian analysis*  described in [Methodology](/method]).

## Overall assessment for polling through September 18, 2024

Harris is likely to lose six of the seven swing states. She is strongest in Wisconsin where not all of the credible interval is below 50%, as it is with the other states. This would result in a 226-312 loss. (225-313 if Nebraska adopts winner take all.)

## Focus

**New voters** from either citizens turning 18 or from newly naturalized citizens are a major blind spot in the polls. The swing state margins were generally under 100,000 votes, and some where approaching only 10,000. In each swing state, there are enough of these [new voters](/newvoters) to determine the outcome.
