## Overall assessment

### Stringent view

Based on the criterion that the model must show Biden taking at least 50.25% of the two-candidate split, Bidin would win only Nevada and its six electoral votes, resulting in **231-307 Electoral College loss.**

### Historical view

Based on the criterion that the model shows Biden doing at least as well as he did in 2020 in the two-candidate split, Biden would win *only* Arizona and Nevada with their combined 17 electoral votes resulting in a **246-292 Electoral College loss.**

### Relaxed view

Based on the criterion that the model shows Biden winning by at least 50% plus one vote of the two-candidate split, Biden would six of the seven swing states (having lost in North Carolina), Biden would take 77 electoral votes resulting in a **302-236 Electoral College victory.**

The poll results conducted in the seven swing states in March and April show presidential preference divided, but favoring Trump in more states than Biden. Each of the poll results has a greater or smaller degree of uncertainty that depends primarily on how many answers were collected. 

The model is based on the *Bayesian analysis*  described in [Methodology](/method]) It begins with the relative share of the two-candidate popular vote won by Biden in each of the swing states in 2020 adjusted by the effect of polling conducted in April. Beginning next month, the beginning point will be adjusted to reflect a cumulative model in which cumulative results will be reporting.

A total of 45 electoral votes from the swing states is a win, given his safe state edge of 225-220 over Trump.

The model is **not** a prediction, but only a projection using stated assumptions. Is is only a mathematical representation of the combined information that is derivable from the actual results of millions of voters in those states and the survey responses of hundreds of voters from the same states. Little weight should be given to the likelihoods so far in advance of the election. Beginning with the reports of August polls, expected in early September, political polls historically begin to approximate electoral results. 

## Current news

### Arizona

[Arizona repealed its 1864 law](https://apnews.com/article/arizona-governor-abortion-ban-1864-signing-07bba2fa805971be62b800bd89c81a5a) effective 90 days after adjournment of the Legislature, so the near total ban remains in effect until early summer. A ballot initiative to replace the 16 week ban that will govern abortions following the effective date of the repeal is gathering signatures. It would set viability, usually around 24 weeks, as the period during which abortion would be permitted generally. The Florida six-week ban went into effect on May 1, 2024. It is too early to measure what effect, if any the abortion issue will have on turnout and the effect on the presidential election. May 2, 2024.

### Nevada acceptance of mailed ballots after election day

On May 3, 2025, the Republican National Committee and others filed a complaint in Federal District Court for the District of Nevada against Nevada election officials seeking to prevent mail-in ballots not received by election day from being counted. 

REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE; NEVADA REPUBLICAN PARTY; DONALD J.TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT 2024, INC.; and DONALD J. SZYMANSKI, Plaintiffs, v.CARI-ANN BURGESS, in her official capacity as the Washoe County Registrar of Voters; JAN GALASSINI, in her official capacity as the Washoe County Clerk; LORENA PORTILLO, in her official capacity as the Clark County Registrar of Voters; LYNN MARIE GOYA, in her official capacity as the Clark County Clerk; FRANCISCO AGUILAR, in his official capacity as Nevada Secretary of State, Defendants. Case 3:24-cv-00198.

> Nevada contravenes those federal laws by counting mail ballots that are
received up to four business days after Election Day, Nev. Rev. Stat. §293.269921(1)(b),
and by presuming that ballots received up to three days after Election Day “have been
postmarked on or before the day of the election,” id. §293.269921(2). Nevada effectively
extends Nevada’s federal election past the Election Day established by Congress. 

**Comment** Similar actions can be expected in all other jurisdictions that have similar arrangements. One of the allegations cites the 

> Exercising that power [pursuant to the Electors Clause], Congress has established that “[t]he electors of President and Vice President shall be appointed, in each State, *on election day*, in accordance with the laws of the State enacted prior to election day.” 3 U.S.C. §1. [*emphasis added*]

which could also be used to argue that electors must be appointed on election day and that no votes counted after midnight can be considered.

## Focus

## Without the Nebraska Second

The models assume that except for the seven swing states, each candidate will win the states and election districts won in 2020. For Biden, the total includes a Nebraska
district that centers on Omaha. Nebraska is one of two states that have this arrangement. The other is Maine. An attempt was made earlier this year to change Nebraska to the winner-take-all system used by other states. It was unsuccessful, and it is not clear if another attempt will be made. Should it be or if the Nebraska Second this time votes for Trump, possible outcomes differ.

A tie outcome that was produced by Biden winning only Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, now has three different possible scenarios

* Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania
* Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and North Carolina
* Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania

Those three scenarios, which were formally wins, are replaced as the smallest possible victories by

* Nevada, Wisconsin, Arizona and Pennsylvania
* Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania
* Arizona, Pennsylvania and NC North Carolina
