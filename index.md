The poll results collected in the seven swing states show presidential preference evenly divided, favoring Biden in some states and Trump in others. Each of the poll results has a greater or smaller degree of uncertainty that depends primarily on how many answers were collected. 

This model begins with the relative share of the popular vote won by Biden in each of the swing states in 2020 adjusted by the most recent polls in each swing, weighted by the number of respondents and taking into account the margins of error. See [methodology](/method). The confidence interval is very wide at the 95% level, even wider than the margin of error of the polls. The combination of the 2020 results and the polling data tell us nothing but that it is possible that either Biden or Trump could win based on the data examined. It is quite close. As new polls come in, the updated assessment will add the new information to the model and may (or may not) move the needle. The data suggest, with some uncertainty, that Biden will win, except in North Carolina, if we simply take 50.01% of the relative vote share. When we discount the expectation of victory by the expectation, President Biden will win 46-47 of the 93 electoral votes of the swing states, and 45 is a win, given his safe state edge of 225-220 over Trump.

The model is **not** a prediction, but only a projection using a raft of assumptions. Is is only a mathematical representation of the combined information that is derivable from the actual results of millions of voters in those states and the survey responses of hundreds of voters from the same states. No weight should be given to the likelihoods so far in advance of the election. Beginning with the reports of August polls, expected in early September, political polls historically begin to approximate electoral results. 

So, the following poll summaries, which do not take into account the last election, provide, individually, even less information than it first appears.
