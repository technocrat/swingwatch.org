The poll does not specify whether the panel (N = 1305) was divided into subgroups for the presidential preference questions. Assuming that it was sub-grouped, half of the panel (N = 653) were asked to choose among “Joe Biden, the Democrat,” “Donald Trump, the Republican,” “Other,” “Do not plan to vote,” or “No opinion.” That is reflected in the two-way plot above. In the plot below (N = 652), the choices were “Joe Biden, the Democrat”, “Donald Trump, the Republican,” “Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., an independent”, “Cornel West, an independent”,” Other,” “Do not plan to vote,” “No opinion.”
