@def title = "Credibility Interval"
In opinion polling, a credibility interval is a statistical measure used to express the uncertainty or variability of an estimate, specifically in the context of non-probability opt-in online polls. It provides a range of values within which the true value of a parameter (e.g., the percentage of people supporting a particular candidate) is likely to lie, with a certain level of confidence. This concept is rooted in Bayesian statistics, which incorporates prior knowledge or beliefs about the parameter in addition to the observed data.

The credibility interval is similar to the classical margin of sampling error (MOE) in that both are designed to convey the statistical uncertainty of polling results. However, there are significant differences between the two. The credibility interval explicitly depends on the underlying assumptions tied to the statistical model chosen for the study, making it model-dependent. In contrast, the classical margin of sampling error primarily depends on the sampling design and the size of the sample, with some implicit assumptions.

For example, if a poll found that 47% of respondents favor a particular candidate with a 95% credibility interval of 3 percentage points, it means there is a 95% chance that the true percentage of people supporting the candidate is between 44% and 50%. This interpretation is contingent on the statistical model's assumptions holding true. If these assumptions fail, the validity of the credibility interval is compromised.

Credibility intervals are particularly useful in situations where traditional probability sampling methods are not feasible, such as with online opt-in polls. They allow pollsters to account for biases and uncertainties inherent in non-probability sampling by incorporating external factors and prior knowledge into their calculations. However, the reliance on statistical modeling choices and the necessity of assuming the sample design is "conditionally ignorable" means that the interpretation of credibility intervals requires caution. The public and media are advised to understand that credibility intervals cannot be relied upon in the same way as traditional margins of sampling error, especially since there is no straightforward way to validate the models upon which they are based[1][2][3][4].
