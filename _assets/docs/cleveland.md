Grover Cleveland's presidential campaigns were notable for their historical significance and the political climate of the times. Here's a summary of his campaigns:

### 1884 Presidential Campaign
- **Background**: Grover Cleveland emerged as a Democratic candidate with a reputation for honesty and fighting corruption. He had previously served as Sheriff of Erie County, Mayor of Buffalo, and Governor of New York[7].
- **Democratic Nomination**: Cleveland secured the Democratic nomination on the second ballot at the convention, with Thomas A. Hendricks as his running mate[7].
- **Campaign Strategy**: Running on a platform of honesty and reform, Cleveland was supported by reformist Republicans known as Mugwumps, who were disillusioned with their candidate, James G. Blaine, due to his perceived corruption[7].
- **Scandals**: Cleveland's campaign faced a scandal regarding allegations he fathered a child out of wedlock. Cleveland addressed the issue head-on, admitting to financial support for the child, which helped him recover from the scandal[7].
- **Outcome**: Cleveland narrowly won the election, defeating Republican James G. Blaine. The victory was particularly significant in New York, where he won by just over 1,000 votes, providing the margin of victory in the Electoral College[3].

### 1888 Presidential Campaign
- **Background**: Cleveland, now the incumbent, ran for re-election against Republican Benjamin Harrison[5].
- **Tariff Reform**: The central issue of the campaign was tariff reform, with Cleveland advocating for a reduction in protective tariffs, contrasting with the Republican protectionist position[5].
- **Campaign Events**: The campaign was marked by the "Murchison Letter" scandal, where a British ambassador's endorsement of Cleveland may have cost him votes[6].
- **Outcome**: Cleveland won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College to Harrison, marking the second time in American history that a candidate won the popular vote but lost the presidency[5].

### 1892 Presidential Campaign
- **Background**: After losing in 1888, Cleveland decided to run again in the 1892 election, facing incumbent President Harrison in a rematch[2].
- **Democratic Nomination**: Cleveland's return to politics was driven by his desire to maintain the gold standard and prevent his political rival, New York Governor David B. Hill, from winning the Democratic nomination[2].
- **Campaign Strategy**: Cleveland did not actively campaign much, partially due to the First Lady's illness. His vice presidential nominee, Adlai Stevenson, campaigned heavily on their behalf[2].
- **Financials**: Cleveland's campaign spent more than Harrison's, with significant fundraising efforts by his campaign manager, William C. Whitney[2].
- **Outcome**: Cleveland won the general election by the largest popular vote margin in twenty years and a substantial majority in the Electoral College, becoming the first and only ex-President to be elected again[2].

Throughout his campaigns, Cleveland was known for his integrity, commitment to reform, and opposition to special favors for economic groups. His presidency was marked by his efforts to regulate the railroads, reduce tariffs, and maintain the gold standard, despite facing economic depression during his second term[1].
