s have to have 26, ties don't count, so at least one R state has to flip and no Democrat or tied seats can flip

ME seat has to be defended by D, else R has 27
MN seat has to be defended, else 27 or 28
NC seat has to be defended, else 27, 28 or 29

x 

These states had more Republican than Democratic representatives in the House, giving the Republican Party the majority of the delegation from these states. Keep in mind that the composition of the House can change after elections and other political events, so it's important to check the most current information for the latest details.
There are three tied states, ME MN NC

Deadlock able states
Based on the latest information available, the states where the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives is determined by only one member include:

- **Kansas**: 3 Republicans to 1 Democrat
- **Mississippi**: 3 Republicans to 1 Democrat
- **Maine**: 1 Republican to 1 Democrat (not a majority but equally split)
- **Nevada**: 3 Democrats to 1 Republican

if all  flipped
Now 5 tied
A majority of 45 is 23

R lose Kansas, Mississippi, still have at least 24, 25 if main flips their way



Win ME only 27
Win ME plus MN 28
Win ME plus NC 28
Win ME plus MN plus NC 29

outcomes:

Win ME only target result = 27, greater than target
Win MN only target result = 28, greater than target
Win NC only target result = 28, greater than target
Win NV only target result = 28, greater than target
Lose ME only target result = 26, equals target
Lose MN only target result = 25, misses target
Lose NC only target result = 25 misses target
Lose KS only target result = 25 misses target
Lose MS only target result = 25 misses target


For wagers = [ME,MN,NC,NV,KS,MS] where each can take 1 or 0 as a value, what are all the combinations of 1 and 0
