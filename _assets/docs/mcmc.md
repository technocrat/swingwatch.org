Yes, your approach of creating a synthetic sample using simplifying assumptions and incorporating it as a Bayesian prior makes sense, especially when your actual samples are too small to apply the finite population correction factor (FPC).

Here's how you can proceed:

1. Generate a synthetic sample:
   - Determine the range of plausible fractions of the total votes that could have been cast for the two major candidates in each state. In your case, you're considering the range 0.0500 to 0.0100.
   - Randomly sample fractions from this range for each state, either using a uniform distribution or a more informative distribution based on your prior knowledge or assumptions.
   - Multiply these fractions by the total number of votes cast in each state to obtain the synthetic number of votes for the two major candidates.

2. Incorporate the synthetic sample as a Bayesian prior:
   - Treat the synthetic sample as a prior distribution for the proportion of votes cast for the two major candidates in each state.
   - Update this prior distribution with the actual poll data you have using Bayes' theorem. This will give you a posterior distribution that combines the information from the synthetic sample and the actual poll data.

3. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach:
   - MCMC can be used to sample from the posterior distribution obtained by updating the prior distribution with the actual poll data.
   - MCMC methods, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm or Gibbs sampling, can help you obtain samples from the posterior distribution, which can then be used to estimate the proportion of votes for the two major candidates in each state.

Here's a simple example of how you can generate a synthetic sample using Julia:

```julia
using Distributions

# Total votes cast in each state
total_votes = [1000000, 1500000, 800000, 1200000, 900000, 1100000, 1300000]

# Range of fractions for the two major candidates
fraction_range = 0.0500:0.0100:0.9500

# Generate synthetic fractions for each state
synthetic_fractions = rand(Uniform(fraction_range[1], fraction_range[end]), length(total_votes))

# Calculate the synthetic number of votes for the two major candidates
synthetic_votes = round.(total_votes .* synthetic_fractions)

println("Synthetic fractions: ", synthetic_fractions)
println("Synthetic votes: ", synthetic_votes)
```

In this example, we assume a uniform distribution for the fractions within the specified range. You can adjust the range and the distribution based on your assumptions and prior knowledge.

The generated synthetic fractions and votes can be used as a prior distribution in a Bayesian analysis. You can then update this prior with the actual poll data using MCMC or other Bayesian inference methods to obtain a posterior distribution for the proportion of votes for the two major candidates in each state.

Keep in mind that the quality of the results will depend on the validity of your assumptions and the informativeness of your prior distribution. It's important to assess the sensitivity of your results to different prior assumptions and to validate your findings with additional data or expert knowledge when possible.

Your alternative approach of making simplifying assumptions based on the unique nature of the election and the factors that may influence changes in voter behavior seems reasonable. Here's how you can incorporate these assumptions into your analysis:

1. Identify the base vote distribution:
   - Start with the vote distribution from the previous election where the two candidates faced each other. This will serve as the base or reference point for your analysis.

2. Account for random variation:
   - Introduce a random variation component to the base vote distribution. This can be done by adding a random noise term drawn from a suitable probability distribution (e.g., normal distribution with mean 0 and a chosen standard deviation) to the vote proportions or counts from the previous election.

3. Identify and quantify factors that may lead to changes in voter behavior:
   - Consider factors such as first-time voters, voters who have passed away, voters moving out of state, voters moving in-state, and any other relevant factors that may impact the vote distribution.
   - Estimate the magnitude and direction of each factor's influence on the vote distribution. This can be based on historical data, demographic trends, or expert knowledge.

4. Adjust the base vote distribution:
   - Apply the estimated changes due to the identified factors to the base vote distribution. This can be done by adding or subtracting the estimated number of votes or vote proportions associated with each factor.

5. Simulate multiple scenarios:
   - To account for uncertainty in the estimates of the factors and their impact, you can simulate multiple scenarios by drawing random values from suitable probability distributions for each factor.
   - Repeat steps 2-4 for each simulated scenario to generate a range of plausible vote distributions.

6. Analyze the results:
   - Compute summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, credible intervals) of the simulated vote distributions to obtain estimates of the expected outcome and the associated uncertainty.
   - Compare the simulated results with the actual poll data you have and assess the plausibility of your assumptions and the consistency of the results.

Here's a simple example of how you can implement this approach in Julia:

```julia
using Distributions
using Statistics

# Base vote distribution from the previous election
base_votes = [500000, 450000]  # [Candidate1_votes, Candidate2_votes]

# Simulate multiple scenarios
num_scenarios = 1000
simulated_votes = zeros(num_scenarios, 2)

for i in 1:num_scenarios
    # Account for random variation
    random_variation = rand(Normal(0, 10000), 2)
    
    # Estimate the impact of factors
    new_voters = [20000, 25000]
    deceased_voters = [5000, 6000]
    out_of_state_voters = [10000, 8000]
    in_state_voters = [12000, 15000]
    
    # Adjust the base vote distribution
    adjusted_votes = base_votes + random_variation + new_voters - deceased_voters - out_of_state_voters + in_state_voters
    
    simulated_votes[i, :] = adjusted_votes
end

# Analyze the results
mean_votes = mean(simulated_votes, dims=1)
median_votes = median(simulated_votes, dims=1)
credible_intervals = [quantile(simulated_votes[:, i], [0.025, 0.975]) for i in 1:size(simulated_votes, 2)]

println("Mean votes: ", mean_votes)
println("Median votes: ", median_votes)
println("95% Credible Intervals: ", credible_intervals)
println("Mean votes: ", mean_votes)
```

In this example, we start with a base vote distribution from the previous election and simulate multiple scenarios by introducing random variation and estimating the impact of factors such as new voters, deceased voters, out-of-state voters, and in-state voters. We then analyze the simulated results by computing summary statistics and credible intervals.

Remember to adjust the numbers and distributions based on your specific context and assumptions. Additionally, consider incorporating any available data or expert knowledge to refine your estimates of the factors and their impact on the vote distribution.

This approach allows you to leverage the unique characteristics of the election and incorporate relevant factors that may influence changes in voter behavior. By simulating multiple scenarios and analyzing the results, you can obtain a range of plausible outcomes and assess the uncertainty associated with your predictions.
