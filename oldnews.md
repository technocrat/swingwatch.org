### General

Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom (NFRF) made an advisory opinion request to the Federal Election Commission regarding the application of the Federal Election Campaign Act and Commission regulations to federal candidates' and officeholders' activities in support of a state ballot initiative. NFRF is a Section 401(c)(4) tax-exempt organization and has a political action committee. NFRF asked if federal candidates and office holders may solicit funds on behalf of NFRF and its PAC without restrictions on amount or source both before and after the ballot initiative qualifies for the election. Because ballot initiatives are not "elections" within the meaning of the Act, restrictions otherwise applicable under the Act do not apply to this type of fundraising.

### Arizona

[Arizona repealed its 1864 law](https://apnews.com/article/arizona-governor-abortion-ban-1864-signing-07bba2fa805971be62b800bd89c81a5a) effective 90 days after adjournment of the Legislature, so the near total ban remains in effect until early summer. A ballot initiative to replace the 16 week ban that will govern abortions following the effective date of the repeal is gathering signatures. It would set viability, usually around 24 weeks, as the period during which abortion would be permitted generally. The Florida six-week ban went into effect on May 1, 2024. It is too early to measure what effect, if any the abortion issue will have on turnout and the effect on the presidential election. May 2, 2024.

### Nevada acceptance of mailed ballots after election day

On May 3, 2025, the Republican National Committee and others filed a complaint in Federal District Court for the District of Nevada against Nevada election officials seeking to prevent mail-in ballots not received by election day from being counted. 

REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE; NEVADA REPUBLICAN PARTY; DONALD J.TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT 2024, INC.; and DONALD J. SZYMANSKI, Plaintiffs, v.CARI-ANN BURGESS, in her official capacity as the Washoe County Registrar of Voters; JAN GALASSINI, in her official capacity as the Washoe County Clerk; LORENA PORTILLO, in her official capacity as the Clark County Registrar of Voters; LYNN MARIE GOYA, in her official capacity as the Clark County Clerk; FRANCISCO AGUILAR, in his official capacity as Nevada Secretary of State, Defendants. Case 3:24-cv-00198.

> Nevada contravenes those federal laws by counting mail ballots that are received up to four business days after Election Day, Nev. Rev. Stat. §293.269921(1)(b), and by presuming that ballots received up to three days after Election Day “have been postmarked on or before the day of the election,” id. §293.269921(2). Nevada effectively extends Nevada’s federal election past the Election Day established by Congress. 

**Comment** Similar actions can be expected in all other jurisdictions that have similar arrangements. One of the allegations cites the 

> Exercising that power [pursuant to the Electors Clause], Congress has established that “[t]he electors of President and Vice President shall be appointed, in each State, *on election day*, in accordance with the laws of the State enacted prior to election day.” 3 U.S.C. §1. [*emphasis added*]

which could also be used to argue that electors must be appointed on election day andwhich could also be used to argue that electors must be appointed on election day and that no votes counted after midnight can be considered. However, that argument runs counter to 3 U.S.C. § 5

> (a)In general.--
> (1) Certification.--Not later than the date that is 6 days before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors, the executive of each State shall issue a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors, under and in pursuance of the laws of such State providing for such appointment and ascertainment enacted prior to election day.
