[^3]: Results are for two-way preference questions if asked, except in cases in which a third-party candidate qualified for the ballot prior to poll. For polls with only multiple choices besides Biden and Trump, their respective percentages of responses were recorded. In all cases those percentages were normalized to 100% to reflect the relative, not absolute, support of the two candidates.
